Dan Hill will be leading an interactive talk on the war on the Western Front, placing each battle in context, explaining how warfare continually evovled and linking the entire four years of conflict into a single narrative. The front four rows won’t get wet - but will probably be conscripted. Not one to miss!</p>

Revisiting the winning formula of diaries and memoirs, and above all original photographs taken on illegally-held cameras by the soldiers themselves, Richard tells the story of 1918, of both the ferocious spring offensive that so nearly brought victory for the Germans in the West, and the tenacious British rearguard fight that thwarted them. The book also tells the vivid story of the Allied breakthrough and the return to open warfare that was to bring victory in November 1918.</p>
